# Certificates

This folder contains the certificates I have earned from TryHackMe to showcase my completed cybersecurity learning paths and challenges.

## Included Certificates

- [Advent of Cyber 2025 Certificate](adventofcyber2025.pdf) – Completed all 24 challenges  
- [Pre Security Learning Path Certificate](pre-security-certificate.pdf) – Completed foundational cybersecurity modules

## Notes

- Certificates are proof of hands-on learning and skill development in cybersecurity.  
- All labs and learning tasks were completed manually.  
- AI tools were only used to help structure explanations and documentation.
